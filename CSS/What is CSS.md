# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects like SVG or XHTML). CSS is crucial in web development as it separates the structure and content of a document from its presentation.

## Purpose of CSS

The primary purpose of CSS is to style and format web documents. It allows web designers and developers to control the layout, appearance, and formatting of multiple web pages simultaneously, making it easier to maintain and update a website.

## How CSS Works

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them through rules defined in a stylesheet. Styles include properties such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS styles can be applied inline within HTML elements, in the head of an HTML document, or in external style sheets that can be linked to multiple HTML documents.

## Cascading Nature

The term **Cascading** in CSS refers to the order of priority when multiple styles conflict. Styles can be inherited from parent elements, defined in external style sheets, or applied inline, and the browser follows a specific order to determine which styles take precedence.

In summary, CSS is a fundamental technology in web development, enabling consistent and visually appealing presentation across various devices and screen sizes.
