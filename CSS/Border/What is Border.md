The `border` property is used to set the style, color, and width of an element's border. It can be specified in a shorthand format or individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left). The three components of the `border` property are:

1. **Width (`border-width`):** Specifies the thickness of the border.

2. **Style (`border-style`):** Specifies the style of the border, such as solid, dashed, dotted, etc.

3. **Color (`border-color`):** Specifies the color of the border.

When using the shorthand `border` property, the order of these components is typically `width`, `style`, and then `color`. For example, `border: 2px solid #000000;` sets a border with a thickness of 2 pixels, a solid style, and a black color.

Alternatively, you can set these components individually for each side using properties like `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, and `border-left`. Each of these properties can have its own `width`, `style`, and `color` values.
