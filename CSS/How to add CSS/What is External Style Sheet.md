An external style sheet is a separate file containing `CSS` (Cascading Style Sheets) code that is used to define the visual presentation and layout of `HTML` documents. Instead of placing the styles directly within the HTML document using inline styles or within a `<style>` block in the document **head**, you create a separate `CSS` file with a `.css` extension. This file can then be linked to multiple `HTML` documents, allowing you to apply consistent styles across multiple pages.
