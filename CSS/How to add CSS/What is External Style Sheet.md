An external style sheet is a separate file containing CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code that is used to define the visual presentation and layout of **HTML** documents. Instead of placing the styles directly within the HTML document using inline styles or within a **<style>** block in the document **head**, you create a separate CSS file with a .css extension. This file can then be linked to multiple **HTML** documents, allowing you to apply consistent styles across multiple pages.

### Here's an example of how to create and use an external style sheet:

###### HTML



###### CSS



### I have uploaded images for you to check in one place. For the code, you can refer to the two files provided.
