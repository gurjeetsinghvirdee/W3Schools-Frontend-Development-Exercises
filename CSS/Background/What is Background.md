The `background` property is used to set the background styling of an element. It can be applied to various HTML elements such as `<body>`, `<div>`, `<p>`, etc. The background property can be used to set different aspects of the background, including color, image, and positioning.

##### Here is a basic example of using the background property to set the background color of an element:

```CSS

.example {
  background-color: #ffffff;
}

```

In this example, the `background` color is set to a white color `(#ffffff)`. You can also use named colors or other color representations, such as RGB or HSL values.

The `background` property can have several sub-properties, and you can combine them as needed. Here are some commonly used sub-properties of the `background` property:

- `background-color`: Specifies the background color.
- `background-image`: Specifies the background image.
- `background-repeat`: Specifies how the background image should repeat (e.g., `repeat`, `no-repeat`, `repeat-x`, `repeat-y`).
- `background-position`: Specifies the starting position of the background image.
- `background-size`: Specifies the size of the background image.
- `background-attachment`: Specifies whether the background image scrolls with the content or remains fixed.

In this example, the background color is set, an image is used as the background, it won't repeat, it's centered, covers the entire element, and remains fixed as the content is scrolled.
