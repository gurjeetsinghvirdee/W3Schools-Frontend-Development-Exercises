## CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. They define the criteria for targeting specific elements based on their type, attributes, relationships with other elements, and more. Here are some common types of CSS selectors:

1. **Element Selector:**
   - Targets HTML elements by their tag name. Here is an example of [Element Selector](./Element_Selector.css)

2. **Class Selector:**
   - Targets elements with a specific class attribute. Here is an example of [Class Selector](./Class_Selector.css)

3. **ID Selector:**
   - Targets a specific element with a given ID. Here is an example of [ID Selector](./ID_Selector.css)

4. **Descendant Selector:**
   - Targets an element that is a descendant of another specified element. Here is an example of [Descendant Selector](./Descendant%20Selector.css)

5. **Child Selector:**
   - Targets an element that is a direct child of another specified element. Here is an example of [Child Selector](./Child%20Selector.css)

6. **Attribute Selector:**

Selectors play a crucial role in CSS, allowing for selective application of styles to different elements in HTML documents. They provide flexibility and granularity in styling, contributing to the creation of visually appealing and well-organized web pages. Understanding and utilizing CSS selectors is essential for effective styling and layout control in web development.
