    In HTML, headings are defined using the <strong> h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 </strong> elements. 
    These elements represent headings of different levels, with h1 being the highest (most important) level and h6 being the lowest.
</p>

<span>Here's an explanation of each heading element:</span> <br>
    
<strong>h1:</strong> Represents the highest level of heading. It is typically used for main headings or titles on a page. <br>
<strong>h2:</strong>Represents a level-2 heading. It is used for subheadings or sections that are slightly less important than the main heading. <br>
<strong>h4 to h6</strong> Represent heading levels of decreasing importance. They are used for subsections, sub-subsections, and so on. <br>

<span>Here's an example of how heading elements are used in HTML:</span> <br>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Heading Example</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>

  <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
  <p>This is a subsection under the main heading.</p>

  <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
  <p>Another subsection under the main heading.</p>

  <h3>Sub-subheading</h3>
  <p>A sub-subsection under one of the subheadings.</p>

</body>
</html>

<p>
    In this example, the <strong>h1</strong> element is used for the main heading, <strong>h2</strong> elements are used for subheadings, and <strong>h3</strong> is used for a sub-subheading. 
    The choice of heading level conveys the hierarchy and importance of the content on the page. Headings also play a crucial role in improving accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
