## Overview

In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), elements serve as the fundamental building blocks for constructing web pages. HTML documents are formed by combining various elements, each defined by tags. These tags encompass opening and closing parts, with content enclosed in between.

## Structure

1. **Opening Tag:** Elements commence with an opening tag, denoted by the element name enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`).

2. **Content:** The content, representing the specific information or structure, is placed between the opening and closing tags.

3. **Closing Tag:** Elements conclude with a closing tag, similar to the opening tag but including a forward slash before the element name.
