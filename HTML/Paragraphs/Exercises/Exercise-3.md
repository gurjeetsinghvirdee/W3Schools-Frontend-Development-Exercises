#### What is Horizontal Rule?
A **Horizontal Rule** is represented by the `<hr>` (horizontal rule) tag. The `<hr>` tag is an empty, self-closing tag used to create a thematic break or horizontal line in the content. It is often used to separate sections of a webpage or to visually indicate a division between different types of content. The `<hr>` tag does not require a closing tag.

When the browser encounters the `<hr>` tag, it typically draws a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. The appearance of the line can be influenced by CSS styling if additional customization is desired.
