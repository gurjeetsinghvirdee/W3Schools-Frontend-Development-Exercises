#### What is Line Break?
A line break is represented by the `<br>` tag. It is a self-closing tag used to create a line break within the content, forcing the subsequent text or elements to appear on a new line. The `<br>` tag is typically employed when you want to insert a manual line break, as opposed to relying on the default flow of block-level elements in HTML.
