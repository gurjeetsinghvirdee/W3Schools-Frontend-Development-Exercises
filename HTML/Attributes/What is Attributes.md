In HTML, attributes are additional information provided within the opening tag of an element. They modify the behavior or appearance of the element. Here's an example of how you might use attributes in HTML, represented in Markdown format for clarity:

# HTML Attributes Examples

## 1. **`id` Attribute**

The `id` attribute provides a unique identifier for an element.

```html
<p id="unique-paragraph">This is a paragraph with a unique ID.</p>
```

## 2. **`class` Attribute**

The `class` attribute assigns one or more class names to an element, allowing you to apply styles or select elements with JavaScript.

```html
<div class="info-box">This is a styled information box.</div>
```

## 3. **`src` Attribute**

The `src` attribute specifies the source URL of embedded content, such as images.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A descriptive text for the image">
```

## 4. **`href` Attribute**

The `href` attribute is used with anchor (`<a>`) elements to specify the destination of a link.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

## 5. **`alt` Attribute**

The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for images, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.

```html
<img src="broken-image.jpg" alt="Image not available">
```

## 6. **`style` Attribute**

The `style` attribute allows inline CSS styling for an element.

```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This paragraph has inline styles.</p>
```

These are just a few examples, and there are many more attributes available in HTML for various elements, each serving different purposes. Attributes enhance the functionality and presentation of HTML elements.
