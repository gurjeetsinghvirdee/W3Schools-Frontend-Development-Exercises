Functions are a fundamental building block of the language and play a crucial role in structuring code, promoting reusability, and encapsulating logic. A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. Functions allow you to group related code together, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.

###### Here's a basic structure of a function in JavaScript:

```JavaScript

function functionName(parameters) {
    // Code to be executed
    return result; // Optional return statement
}

```

- **`functionName:`** This is the name of the function. You can choose a meaningful name to describe what function does.
- **`parameters:`** These are placeholders for values that the function expects to receive when it is called. Parameters are optional.
- **`Code to be executed:`** This is the block of code that is executed when the function is called.
- **`return statement:`** This is optional and is used to specify the value that the function should return.
