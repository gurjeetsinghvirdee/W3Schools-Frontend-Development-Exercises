In JavaScript, data types represent the kind of values that variables can hold. JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime. Here are the primary data types in JavaScript:

- [Number](./Examples/Number.js): Represents numeric values.
- [String](./Examples/String.js): Represents sequences of characters.
- [Boolean](./Examples/Array.js): Represents true or false values.
- [Array](./Examples/Array.js): Represents ordered collections of values.
- [Object](./Examples/Object.js): Represents collections of key-value pairs.
- [Undefined](./Examples/Undefined.js): Represents the absence of a value or an uninitialized variable.
- [Null](./Examples/Null.js): Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- [Function](./Examples/Function.js): Represents executable code.
- [Symbol (ES6 and later)](./Examples/Symbol.js): Represents unique and immutable values.
- [BigInt (ES2020 and later)](./Examples/BigInt.js): Represents arbitrary precision integers.
