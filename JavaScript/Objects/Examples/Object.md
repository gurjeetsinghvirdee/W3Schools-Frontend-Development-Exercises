In this [Example](./Object.js), `make`, `model`, `year`, and `color` are properties of the `car` object, and `start` and `drive` are methods. The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. So, this.make and `this.model` refer to the `make` and `model` properties of the `car` object. You can access object properties in two ways: `objectName.propertyName` or `objectName["propertyName"]`. For example, you can access the `make` property of the `car` object like this: `car.make` or `car["make"]`. You can call methods in the following way: `objectName.methodName()`. For example, you can call the start method of the `car` object like this: `car.start()`.
