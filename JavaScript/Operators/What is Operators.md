# JavaScript Operators

In JavaScript, operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands. Operands can be values, variables, or expressions. This document provides an overview of common types of operators in JavaScript.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values.

- `+` (addition)
- `-` (subtraction)
- `*` (multiplication)
- `/` (division)
- `%` (modulo, remainder)
- `++` (increment)
- `--` (decrement)

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=` (assign)
- `+=` (add and assign)
- `-=` (subtract and assign)
- `*=` (multiply and assign)
- `/=` (divide and assign)

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a boolean result.

- `==` (equality)
- `===` (strict equality)
- `!=` (inequality)
- `!==` (strict inequality)
- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values.

- `&&` (logical AND)
- `||` (logical OR)
- `!` (logical NOT)

## Unary Operators

Unary operators operate on a single operand.

- `+` (unary plus)
- `-` (unary minus)
- `++` (increment)
- `--` (decrement)

These are the fundamental types of operators in JavaScript, allowing you to perform various operations and comparisons in your code.
