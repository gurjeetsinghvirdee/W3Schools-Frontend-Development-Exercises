Events are actions or occurrences that happend in the sysytem you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.
Here are some key points about events:

- *What is an event?*
  Events are things that happen in the system you are programming. For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box.

- *HTML Events:* 
  HTML events can be something the browser does, or something a user does. Examples of HTML events include a webpage finishing loading, an HTML input field being changed, or an HTML button being clicked.

- *Event Handlers:*
  To react to an event, you attach an event handler to it. This is a block code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create that runs when the event fires).

- *Common HTML Events:*
  Some common HTML events include `[onchange](./Examples/onchange/)` (an HTML element has been changed), `[onclick](./Examples/onclick/)` (the user clicks an HTML element), `[onmouseover](./Examples/onmouseover/)` (the user moves the mouse over from an HTML element), `[onmouseout](./Examples/onmouseout/)` (the user moves the mouse away from an HTML element), `[onkeydown](./Examples/onkeydown/)` (the user pushes a keyword key), and `[onload](./Examples/onload/)` (the browser has finished loading the page).
