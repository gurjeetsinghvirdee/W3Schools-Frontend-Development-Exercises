# JavaScript Variables

In JavaScript, variables are used as containers for storing data values. They allow developers to manipulate and manage information within a program. JavaScript variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare the data type when creating a variable.

## Variable Declaration

JavaScript provides three keywords for variable declaration:

1. **var:**
   - Used in older versions of JavaScript (ES5).
   - Has function-level scope.

2. **let:**
   - Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).
   - Has block-level scope.

3. **const:**
   - Also introduced in ES6.
   - Similar to `let`, but a `const` variable cannot be reassigned.

Understanding the differences between these variable declaration keywords and their respective scopes is important for effective JavaScript programming.
